# Netlify redirects for SPA routing
# This ensures that all routes are handled by the client-side router
# Note: Edge functions configured in .netlify/edge-functions/manifest.json
# automatically take precedence over these redirect rules

# Handle all routes as SPA - serve index.html
# The status code 200 means this is a rewrite (not a redirect)
# This allows the Vue Router to handle client-side routing
/*    /index.html   200
